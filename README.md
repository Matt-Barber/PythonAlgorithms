# Algorithms and t'ing #

Hey there - if you're looking at this repo you're interested in Python üêç

This repo is simply a repo I use to dump a selection of algorithms that I write / devise
everything from sorting, to searching, to encoding to decoding.

## Motivation ##

I'm scrubbing up on my Data Structures and Algorithms - so this seems like a great way to keep track

## Tests ##

Each sub folder has the unit tests for all the different types of algorithms

## Contributions ##

Feel free to fork and add contributions at your leisure

## License ##

Free and stuff - a nice mention would be lovely if you're sharing this :)
